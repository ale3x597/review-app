# Review Application Using React

This Project has served as a baseline to continuing my learning and experience with mastering ReactJs. At its heart , this application is a review form which takes in a users comments and a rating and displays them. 

## To Run
- Clone Github Repository
- In console of your prefered IDE perform an "npm install"
- After installation, proceed with npm start

## Continued Development
 I plan on continuing the development of this application as it can function as a component which could be used in a variety of other applications 

## Important npm Commands
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
